CreatorKit is a simple alternative solution to using Disqus to enhance websites with threading and commenting 
and Mailchimp for accepting and managing website newsletters and mailing lists.

It's an ideal companion for JAMStack or statically generated branded websites like 
[Razor SSG](https://razor-ssg.web-templates.io/posts/razor-ssg) 
enabling you to seamlessly integrate features such as comments, voting, moderation, newsletter subscriptions, 
and email management into your existing websites.

No longer do you need to rely on complex content management systems to manage your blog's interactions with your readers. 
With CreatorKit, you can enjoy the convenience of managing your blog's comments, votes, and subscriptions directly 
from your own hosted [CreatorKit Portal](/portal/).

Additionally, CreatorKit makes it easy to send emails and templates to different mailing lists, making it the perfect 
tool for managing your email campaigns. Whether you're a blogger, marketer, or entrepreneur, CreatorKit is a great 
solution for maximizing your blog's functionality and engagement.
